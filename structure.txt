Ideas:

- Allow referring to assets by name

- Allow html fragments to be specified in asset

- Provide constants for relative positioning.  center, corners, center-left, center-right, center-bottom, center-top

- Allow updating asset html contents.

- Loops

- Asset Groups (Seems like HTML dom nodes could handle this need so it would really be to interact with several elements at once using one call)

- Specify seconds for the timecode as opposed to string.  Allow for variables and additive offsets.

- Don't want assets at scene level.  It makes cleanup and preloading difficult.
